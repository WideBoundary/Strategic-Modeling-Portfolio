Strategic Foresight, Delivered at Machine Speed.

# About Me
I am a strategist operating at the intersection of quantitative analysis and artificial intelligence. With a background in the high-stakes environment of financial trading, I bring a rigorous, data-driven approach to solving complex business challenges. My core expertise lies in leveraging advanced generative AI not as a simple tool, but as a dynamic partner to model scenarios, pressure-test strategies, and unlock solutions that are often invisible to traditional analysis.

This portfolio showcases my work as a Strategic Options Modeler. I help organizations navigate uncertainty and make critical decisions with clarity and speed.

# My Philosophy: The Human-AI Collaborative Framework
Traditional consulting is slow and expensive. Automated AI is often generic and lacks nuanced business context. My approach bridges this gap.

I've developed a proprietary Human-AI collaborative framework that transforms complex, ambiguous business problems into structured, actionable strategic options. This isn't about "prompt engineering"; it's about architecting a sophisticated analytical engine tailored to each client's unique situation.

# My process involves:

Problem Decomposition & AI Priming: Deconstructing a challenge into its core vectors and deploying custom AI models primed for the specific strategic landscape.

Multi-Vector Scenario Modeling: Guiding the AI through an iterative process to generate a wide spectrum of potential strategies and outcomes.

Strategic Pressure-Testing & Synthesis: Applying human-led contrarian analysis and risk assessment to refine and synthesize the most viable paths forward into a clear, final report.

The specific methodologies are proprietary, but the results are evident in the case studies below.

# Portfolio of Case Studies
Here you will find selected examples of my work. Each case study demonstrates the application of my framework to a distinct business challenge, resulting in a tangible, high-value strategic deliverable.
